sort is in ascii order by default (uses cmp)
@a = sort(3,4,9,11,23)
print "@a"; 11 23 3 4 9



sort compare code
$a left hand
$b right hand

we return:
-1 to say $a is first(smaller)
0 to say Do not care
1 to say $b is first

@sorted = sort{$a cmp $b}@unsorted
@sorted = sort{$a<=>$b}@unsorted
@k = sort{$a<=>$b}keys%H;
